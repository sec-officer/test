pom.xml,CVE-2024-47535,io.netty:netty-common,4.1.114.Final,4.1.115,HIGH,"Netty is an asynchronous event-driven network application framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol servers & clients. An unsafe reading of environment file could potentially cause a denial of service in Netty. When loaded on an Windows application, Netty attempts to load a file that does not exist. If an attacker creates such a large file, the Netty application crashes. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.1.115.",https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2024-47535
pom.xml,CVE-2022-29599,org.apache.maven.shared:maven-shared-utils,3.1.0,3.3.3,CRITICAL,"In Apache Maven maven-shared-utils prior to version 3.3.3, the Commandline class can emit double-quoted strings without proper escaping, allowing shell injection attacks.",https://avd.aquasec.com/nvd/cve-2022-29599
pom.xml,CVE-2021-26291,org.apache.maven:maven-core,3.0,3.8.1,CRITICAL,"Apache Maven will follow repositories that are defined in a dependencyâ€™s Project Object Model (pom) which may be surprising to some users, resulting in potential risk if a malicious actor takes over that repository or is able to insert themselves into a position to pretend to be that repository. Maven is changing the default behavior in 3.8.1+ to no longer follow http (non-SSL) repository references by default. More details available in the referenced urls. If you are currently using a repository manager to govern the repositories used by your builds, you are unaffected by the risks present in the legacy behavior, and are unaffected by this vulnerability and change to default behavior.
